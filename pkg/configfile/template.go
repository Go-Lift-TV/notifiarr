# Service Checks #
##################

## This application performs service checks on configured services at the specified interval.
## The service states are sent to Notifiarr.com. Failed services generate a notification.
## Setting names on Starr apps (above) enables service checks for that app.
## Use the [[service]] directive to add more service checks. Example below.

[services]
  disabled = {{.Services.Disabled}}   # Setting this to true disables all service checking routines.
  parallel = {{.Services.Parallel}}       # How many services to check concurrently. 1 should be enough.
  interval = "{{.Services.Interval}}" # How often to send service states to Notifiarr.com. Minimum = 5m.
  log_file = '{{.Services.LogFile}}'      # Service Check logs go to the app log by default. Change that by setting a services.log file here.

## Uncomment the following section to create a service check on a URL or IP:port.
## You may include as many [[service]] sections as you have services to check.
## Do not add Radarr, Sonarr, Readarr or Lidarr here! Add a name to enable their checks.
##
## Example with comments follows.
#[[service]]
#  name     = "MyServer"          # name must be unique
#  type     = "http"              # type can be "http" or "tcp"
#  check    = 'http://127.0.0.1'  # url for 'http', host/IP:port for 'tcp'
#  expect   = "200"               # return code to expect (for http only)
#  timeout  = "10s"               # how long to wait for tcp or http checks.
#  interval = "5m"                # how often to check this service.
{{if not .Service}}
## Another example. Remember to uncomment [[service]] if you use this!
##
#[[service]]
#  name    = "Bazarr"
#  type    = "http"
#  check   = 'http://10.1.1.2:6767/series/'
#  expect  = "200"
#  timeout = "10s"{{else}}
## Configured Service Checks:
##{{range .Service}}
[[service]]
  name     = "{{.Name}}"
  type     = "{{.Type}}"
  check    = '{{.Value}}'
  expect   = "{{.Expect}}"
  timeout  = "{{.Timeout}}"
  interval = "{{.Interval}}"
{{end}}{{end}}
